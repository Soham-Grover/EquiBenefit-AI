# EquiBenefit AI Model

## Problem Statement
Growing Economic Inequality - Current reservation system and some government schemes gives freebees basis caste and creed. However, there are many people, basis their economic condition may not need those benefits. On the other hand some people who are economically weak may be deprived of the government schemes which are required for their overall development. 

## AI Based Solution
Since all the Bank accounts and Financial transactions are now linked to PAN and AADHAAR, I propose to use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to analyze the "Data" on a continuous basis and recognize various financial patterns to identify the people who actually need the government schemes and also identify those who don't require those schemes.
